# Coursera Capstone

This project is a submission for a Coursera course. At the end of the IBM data science specialization, the students had to prepare an independent project. My project was a clustering study of the Budapest area, which tried to divide the districts and explain the similarities and differences of the regions based on the places that can be extracted using the foursquare API.

You need a Jupyter notebook to use this project. The report file contains the conclusion, and the notebook file contains the data extraction. The project is written in python and uses the KMeans algorithm for clustering. I used BeautifulSoup to do web scraping to complete the API data. I displayed the maps using Folium.

If you need help, feel free to ask and I will help if I can.

I renamed the categories of venues of Bar, Pub, Beer Bar, Beer Garden, Wine Bar to Bar category. From the venues I exclude the venues of Bus Stop, Bus Station, Tram Station, Train Station, Grocery Store, Ice Cream Shop, Caf\u00e9, Coffee Shop, Smoke Shop, Bistro, Bakery and Pharmacy category, because they are too general and affect the result negatively. Finally the clustering was based on the 5 most common venue categories belonging to the district.</p>\n<p>First of all, we need to define the optimal number of groups. In order to determine this, I chose the Silhouette score and the Elbow method. In the figure below it is shown clearly that for the data I collected, the optimal number of clusters is 5.</p>"

On the map of Budapest generated by the folium library it is clearly visible which districts the algorithm classified into which cluster, based on the common venues found there.

The characteristic of all three areas is that they started to develop when they were attached to Budapest and housing estates began to be built on them. These districts differ the most from all other districts of the capital.</p>\n\n<h2>Discussion:</h2>\n<p>As it was visible in the results section, the distribution of venue categories in the districts of Budapest is basically good. There are more districts in Pest than in Buda, but this has geographical and historical reasons, so it is not worth changing this.</p>\n<p>The venue categories of most districts follow a random distribution. Naturally restaurants are found everywhere, because a lot of people like to have a festive lunch or dinner, and in many households they do not take care of cooking for themselves, but during the day they have a pleasant lunch in a restaurant. Not to mention tourists who are glad to eat Hungarian dishes. Apart from restaurants, there is no clearly typical place for these districts, because each district benefits roughly equally from each category, scattered in different parts of the city.</p>\n<p>In the downtown there are so much life, there are the major attractions, tourists stay in the hotels here, there are a lot of restaurants and nightclubs, the elite of the city. However, this is usually the case in all major cities, so this is not a disorder.</p>\n<p>The surrounding of the rich District 2 differs from the other districts of Budapest. The fact that this area attracts the rich is mainly due to the high-lying plots with good views, which can only be afforded by the wallets of wealthy people. And hearing this attracts other moderately wealthy people who wants a high standard of living to other parts of the district. These people do more costly leisure activities, and healthy lifestyle it is more important for them than for an average person. That is why a tennis court and an athletics and sports center were built here. The solution for eliminating the differences is to make other areas attractive for wealthy people as well. But natural endowments also contribute to this, so we cannot create homes with good views where there is no good view. And in the center of the city there is no opportunity to build a new tennis court complex or an athletics center where people live, because these structures require a huge area.</p>\n<p>There are four districts in Budapest which stick out of the image of the city, and we could also make changes on them. One of them is positioned in Buda, and three in Pest, but we cannot draw any conclusion from this regarding the opposites of the two districts, since Pest has almost three times more districts than Buda.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>"

Metropolitan life can also be realized in these suburban areas, as the venues have all necessary endowments. But this requires new building and services in the target areas. Such things are like cultural facilities, sports and leisure centers, restaurants and nightclubs, and any other development that can bring these districts a little closer to the structure of the average districts of Budapest.</p>"
